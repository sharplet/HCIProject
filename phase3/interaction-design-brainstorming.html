			<h3>Client Meeting</h3>
<p>The main thrust of the meeting today with Jacob was that the user should have more of an awareness of how the information they are reading about fits in with the other information in the current text (and any other sources that have been linked to). This would seem to make most sense in the context of the zooming out gesture. First the zooming out will take the user to the pages view, where they can swipe to jump to a point in the text. This view could display some more information which categorises the concept that they are reading about, and the neighbouring concepts. This could be a colour-coding of related information or pages, or section titles, or some graphical indication that there are relationships between pages. The text in the screenshots could be identified in some way by colour, say with a colour mask. Maybe. Then, if the user is to zoom out again, they will see a more global view of the "information architecture," basically how the concepts in this text are related, and information about what page ranges the concepts are covered in, etc. So say a user gets to this global view, they see how their current topic relates to the topics around, and then they select a parent topic, which takes them to whichever page of the book that section starts on. The user can always get back to the last page they were at after returning from this global view.</p>

<p>Basically, if it's all just text, then the user could potentially still feel lost, or not have the whole context of the information they're reading. With the higher level view, they can see how what they're doing fits with the rest of the book (and the web of other linked info).</p>
