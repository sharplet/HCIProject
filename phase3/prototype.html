<h2>Prototype scope</h2>

<p>The approach taken in developing this prototype was to demonstrate the core functionality of the Digital Textbook App. The features that the prototype demonstrates are those which were intended to solve a particular pre-existent usability issue.</p>

<p>To aid rapid prototyping, screenshots from Apple&rsquo;s iBooks app have been used to simulate the look and feel of the Digital Textbook App, and many interactions are based directly on iBooks. We have demonstrated mostly those interactions which differ from iBooks current implementation.</p>

<h2>Prototype fidelity</h2>

<p>The chosen prototyping tool is Keynote. The screens were constructed with a combination of the following elements:
<ul>
<li>Screenshots of iBooks</li>
<li>UI elements from a Keynote-based iPad prototyping kit</li>
<li>Object animations and slide transitions</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This approach has made reasonably high-fidelity graphics and animations possible without writing a single line of code. Interactivity is simulated with hyperlinks. The prototype is also easily extensible by adding new slides, hyperlinks, animations and stock UI elements.</p>

<h2 id="the_digital_textbook_app_prototype">The Digital Textbook App prototype</h2>

<p>Below is a description of each demonstrated interaction. At the end there is an embedded and interactive Quicktime movie demonstrating the prototype. It is mostly scripted (the interactions are demonstrated in the order they&#8217;ve been described), but animations and transitions are triggered by hyperlinked buttons, so click around and see what you can do.</p>

<p>You can download the Keynote presentation file here: <a href="../files/prototype.key">prototype.key</a>.</p>

<h3 id="turning_pages">Turning pages</h3>
<p>The turning pages interaction is virtually identical to that found in iBooks. Implementing the realistic page turning animation is not a necessary functional requirement, and so a simpler animation may be implemented in the final product.</p>

<h3 id="pinching_to_flick_between_pages">Pinching to flick between pages</h3>
<p>This interaction was inspired by a discrepancy between the way we interact with real physical textbooks, and the way we interact with the current crop of ebook readers available. Paging left and right, bookmarking, searching the web, defining words, highlighting and annotating text are all very doable on ebook readers, but the ability to quickly flick through pages to find the one you&#8217;re after, and to jump back and forth very quickly between sections of a book, are not very fast. The goal of this interaction is to speed up the way a user can navigate around a book, rather than favouring linearly paging left and right.</p>

<p>The user performs a &#8220;pinch to zoom&#8221; gesture, and then sees a zoomed out version of the current page and the nearby pages. Swiping left and right enables the user to very rapidly locate a page, and the thumbnails give the user a visual idea of when they have reached their desired location. The user can then tap on the page they would like to view.</p>

<h3 id="alternating_between_two_pages">Alternating between two pages</h3>
<p>After quickly jumping to a new page using the gesture described above, a button appears in the toolbar that the user can tap to return to their previous location. Subsequent taps to this button alternate between the two pages. At any point, using the jump to page feature again means the button will now alternate between the two new pages.</p>

<p>The rationale for this feature is to emulate the way a user can mark different pages in a book, say to quickly jump between a section in a chapter and the end-of-chapter questions.</p>

<h3 id="traversing_neighbouring_concept_map_links_textually">Traversing neighbouring concept map links textually</h3>
<p>This interaction enables the user to traverse to any neighbouring node in the concept map: that is, to navigate to related content. Whenever a navigation such as this takes place, the user will always have a breadcrumb trail &#8220;back&#8221; button in the upper left corner which they can use to return to their previous location.</p>


<h3 id="traversing_the_concept_map_using_the_global_view">Traversing the concept map using the global view</h3>
<p>The global view ostensibly allows the user to get a visual representation of the concepts in the book they are reading. In addition to this, if a user is tasked with reading about a particular topic and is having difficulty understanding, the user can traverse the parent links in the concept map to find a foundation topic that they do understand, then work their way back to their original position, filling in their understanding as they go.</p>

<h2 id="results_of_meeting_with_client">Results of meeting with client</h2>

<p>At the time of the meeting, the primary interaction demonstrated in the prototype was pinching to zoom out and flick quickly between pages. The client was satisfied with all the interactions we demonstrated. However, he commented that we had not included an important interaction with the concept map. The client explained that an important function of concept maps is to give a user a visual representation of the information they are trying to find, to help them a) find out how the current topic is related to other topics, and b) locate a topic they are familiar with that will help them to understand the current topic.</p>

<p>I implemented this functionality by adding an extra level that the user can zoom out to. In the &#8220;flicking through pages&#8221; view, the user can perform the pinch gesture once more to get a global (and visual) representation of the concept map of the textbook they are reading.</p>
