    <h3 id="field_studies">Overview and interview guide</h3>
    <p>We opted to do in-person interviews. Each of us separately questioned two or three people for a total of 9 interviews. We also developed a list of questions to guide our interviews, though not all interviews included the full list, and neither does the list represent everything we finally discussed.</p>
    <p>This is the question guide we used:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Do you see any problems with textbooks in their current form? (Too heavy, too big? &#8230;)</li>
    <li>Alternately, what frustrates you about ebooks?</li>
    <li>Have you ever read an ebook?</li>
    <li>What do you like/dislike about ebooks?</li>
    <li>What is your opinion on PDF vs. kindle vs. ipad vs. sony, etc.</li>
    <li>Do you think a textbook would work as an ebook? What would be right/wrong with this?</li>
    <li>Do you like to read on the internet?  Laptop? Desktop? Phone?</li>
    <li>What is the most important/best thing about paper books?</li>
    <li>Do you read textbooks front to back, as reference books, or both?</li>
    <li>Estimate of how much time spent reading books? (vs. internet?)</li>
    <li>How much time do you spend reading in one sitting?</li>
    <li>Does reading on a screen hurt your eyes?</li>
    <li>What helps you to read more, or read for longer periods of time? (Things to help concentrate, etc.)</li>
    <li>What time of the day do you like to read? </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
    <p>Although there is a sizable number of people who have strong opinions on textbooks, we preferred to use personal interviews instead of surveys. We decided we wanted to use interviews to explore our interviewees&#8217; opinions, rather than guess at all the relevant issues and prepare a fixed set of questions.</p>

    <h3 id="transcripts">Transcripts</h3>

    <h4 id="1">1</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>has read ebooks, pdfs, completely online (homework software, online)</li>
    <li>alright reading online, bulky computer</li>
    <li>prefer real textbooks</li>
    <li>having the computer with you sucks, overheating</li>
    <li>ipad form factor, but seems to pricey</li>
    <li>full textbooks too expensive, protecting them (Water damage), really heavy</li>
    <li>textbooks used as reference books, not necessarily linearly (mechanical)</li>
    <li>no way to search online books, better way to navigate</li>
    <li>just read on laptop</li>
    <li>lighting is the major issue with how long you read books on screen for</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

    <p>The two most crucial considerations were:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The bulkiness, weight and heat of laptop (or computer) make reading actual books preferable</li>
    <li>Price: iPads are too expensive, and real textbooks are too expensive</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Digital textbooks will be desirable if they are cheap, light and easy to navigate.</p>

    <h4 id="2">2</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>textbooks are heavy, expensive</li>
    <li>if digital textbooks (ebooks) become cheaper, they will be better</li>
    <li>digital version has to be easy on the eyes</li>
    <li>kindle e-ink is promising (for long reading)</li>
    <li>has to be fast to find what you need</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

    <p>Price and weight are the major drawbacks of current textbooks. Price seems to be the major concern, and secondary to this is the readability of the device. Hasn&#8217;t read on iPhone 4.</p>

    <h4 id="3">3</h4>

    <li>Probably prefer a kindle-like device</li>
    <li>No, textbook would not work as well as an ebook. Does not like the way they navigate (possibly because professor scanned book badly)</li>

    <li>Kindle like device > PDF</li>
    <li>Yes, no issues once informed of ability to type notes</li>
    <li>No more or less than an actual book, depends on material</li>
    <li>laptop = main source of internet</li>
    <li>books have no important features, well maybe their security of not having to worry about disk failure wiping out book/notes</li>
    <li>Primarily reference</li>
    <li>95% internet, 5% books</li>
    <li>internet; 20-30 minutes in one sitting hard copy 2-3 hours but probably would be the same on kindle (primarily content rather than method).</li>
