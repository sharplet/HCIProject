    <p>There was a mix of opinions on the current state of textbooks. Common themes included; portability, usability, and information access speed.</p>
    <p>A common observation about portability is that textbooks are easy to physically manipulate. One can opt to read lying on a bed, sitting on a chair, sitting in a park, etc. Furthermore, many people appreciate the ease with which one can flip through pages, and even though it may be slower than an electronic search, the tactile feedback seems important. Electronic devices also generate heat, which can cause discomfort in the close proximity that textbooks usually are.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, many people pointed out the great bulk and weight of most textbooks, which detracts significantly from their portability. Expense was a complaint often raised at the same time as weight, albeit their different natures. A minority of the volunteers observed that many ebook platforms, such as the iPad, have a large price themselves.</p>
    <p>Usability was brought up in two flavors: short term usability (ease of use, user interface, etc) and long term usability (battery, eyestrain). People familiar with the Kindle often offered that as an example of a device with good long term usability, whereas devices such as a laptop would suffer poorly in that category.</p>
    <p>As far as short term usability goes, nearly all volunteers mentioned their desire to search for key words and phrases. There was some mention of the need for annotation and bookmarks as well. The process of adding to the platform content would also have to be fairly streamlined, since people also complained about custom scans that display poorly.</p>
    <p>As for access speed, again, most users requested a search feature. Several also voiced their concern that the devices may have latency, which is not an issue with textbooks. One volunteer speculated on the possibility of designs that differ greatly from traditional textbook structure, which may prove useful in absorbing the book&#8217;s content.</p>
