    <h2 id="scenario_1">Scenario 1</h2>
    <p>Jill has to read a chapter about the Taylor series for her numerical methods class, however she has forgotten much of the basics of the Taylor series that she had learned in calculus and must reteach herself the basics before she moves on to the more advanced material.  She starts by trying to read the assigned chapter from her numerical methods textbook, but quickly becomes lost and frustrated, as the textbook assumes that the reader will have basic knowledge of the Taylor series (<a href="./claims.html#claim1">Claim 1</a>).</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Jill cannot go re-read the introduction to the Taylor series from her old calculus book because she had, in her infinite wisdom, sold her calculus textbook for slightly more than nothing immediately after finishing her calculus course.  Jill then spends entirely too much time trying to sift through poorly formatted math tutorial webpages on the Internet before she finally finds a site that can provide the information she needs in a readable manner (<a href="./claims.html#claim2">Claim 2</a>).  Exhausted and extremely frustrated, Jill decides to put off her actual reading assignment until tomorrow.</p>
    <h3 id="description_of_scenario">Description of scenario</h3>
    <p>For this scenario we really wanted to focus on the problem of not knowing what parts of a textbook will supplement the learning of a certain subject currently being addressed.  Jill’s textbook is assuming basic knowledge; however it is not directing her to a source of said basic knowledge, therefore creating her frustration.  The field study helped us in creating this problem scenario, as many people found that navigating a textbook can be quite problematic.  This scenario is a prime example of this specific problem in action.</p>
    <p>Ideas for this scenario that we rejected include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Jill finding an e-reader difficult to use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="scenario_2">Scenario 2</h2>
    <p>Bill is an excellent student, and has just finished taking a class on statistical analysis.  Bill would like to learn more about statistics, but his university does not offer any more advanced statistics courses.  After absorbing what little of his textbook that his class did not cover, Bill was at a loss for what to do.  Bill posted on an Internet message board asking what books he should read to further his knowledge of statistics, but the feedback he received was varied and often contradictory.</p>
    <p>Bill tried to search the Internet for more information about Statistics and eventually found a website that contained all the knowledge about statistics anyone could ever want (<a href="./claims.html#claim3">Claim 3</a>).  Bill initially had some difficulty figuring out where what he already knew ended and where new information began, but after spending some time getting used to the website&#8217;s interface, he was able to quickly seek out any information he wanted.  Bill spent nearly two hours ecstatically pouring over the wealth of information before him, until he realized that spending so much time reading from a computer screen was beginning to strain his eyes (<a href="./claims.html#claim4">Claim 4</a>).</p>
    <p>Bill was also tired of sitting in his house and wanted to go for a walk in a nearby park as he read (as he often did with his books), however, his laptop was too bulky to walk and read with at the same time, and his smart-phone&#8217;s screen was too small and made reading from and interacting with the website difficult (<a href="./claims.html#claim4">Claim 4</a>).</p>
    <p>Finally, he also noticed that the glare from the sun made it very difficult to read from a screen and made his eyestrain issues even worse (<a href="./claims.html#claim5">Claim 5</a>).  Unable to find a comfortable way to read, Bill eventually gave up on his statistics research and decided to read some mediocre fantasy novel instead.</p>
    <h3 id="description_of_scenario">Description of scenario</h3>
    <p>For this scenario, the problems of usability with current solutions to books online were the main focus.  Obviously this includes the unintuitive interface within the website, the straining of Bill’s eyes, and the lack of portability.  The field study’s that were taken greatly influenced this problem scenario as almost every person interviewed mentioned how reading on the internet for an extended period of time causes issues, as well as how current solutions to this problem do not allow portability.  This scenario does a sufficient job of explaining common problems that students encounter when using digital means to read.</p>
    <p>Ideas for this scenario that we rejected include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Having Bill using Google Books</li>
    <li>Having Bill read in a dark environment.</li>
    </ul>
