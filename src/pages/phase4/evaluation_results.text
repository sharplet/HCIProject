Evaluation results
------------------

### Subjects

- With one exception all participants are male.
- Ages range from 19-24.
- No participants own an iPad or Kindle.
- Participants read an average of 2-3 hours per week.
- Participants may have been biased as prototype interaction was performed with notable tester aid.

### Data ###

#### Participants' responses ####

![Chart of users](../images/users.png)

This graph represents the mean, mode, and variance of a given participant's responses. We analyzed this data to determine whether there were any patterns in the responses, or any significant outliers in baseline rating.

Observations:

- Overall variance is 0.17. This suggests participants rated with a reasonably consistent baseline.
- Another possibility is that our sample was too narrow. 
- There was only one rating of 2, given by Participant 7 for Feature D.
- Participant 7 rated the features consistently high, with the sole exception of Feature D. This anomolous data lends credence to the idea that Participant 7 was trying to rate objectively, and perhaps merits further investigation.

#### Feature ratings ####

![Chart of questions](../images/questions.png)

This graph deals specifically with the features and the ratings given to them. The legend below connects the letters with the actual survey questions.

<table>
<tr><td>A</td><td>Discovering the ability to view concept map links was intuitive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>When following links, I found it easy to return to my original textbook page.</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>Flipping through pages linearly was easy and instinctive.</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>The ìpagesî view of the textbook was as easy to navigate as a paper textbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Navigating through different concepts was made easy with the integration of a concept map.</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>Creation and annotation of notes is an easy to use and desirable feature within the e-textbook.</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>The highlighting tool was easy and intuitive to use.</td></tr>
</table>

Observations:

- Covariance between mean and variance is -.07, indicating that the higher the mean was the lower the variance. This is promising, as it suggests people agreed more on highly rated features.
- Features A, C, E, and G were largely agreed to be successful features.
- Feature D was the most contentious.
- Only Feature D was outside of 1 standard deviation. Other data points should be considered reliable.

### Interview Observations

- 5/8 participants mentioned highlighting as a strength of the prototype over traditional textbooks.
- The above seemed contingent on there being a way to remove the highlighting.
- 6/8 mentioned the concept map or related features as a strength, insofar as they supervened on the normal book experience.
- 4/8 mentioned the inconvenience of reading from a screen as a prominent dislike.
- 6/8 would use the ebook reader if available instead of traditional textbooks. The remaining two mentioned the intrinsic enjoyment of tactile feedback as counter reasons.
- Several mentioned weight as the main reason why they would use the ebook reader over traditional textbooks.
- Highlighting for e-books did not feel destructive, which alleviates a psychological downside to traditional textbooks.
- One user remarked on the great convenience of the quick-bookmark feature.

### Conclusions

- Cannot remove highlighting once it is in place. Must rectify this.
- Page flipping feature is contested, but data is too inconsistent to make a firm judgment. Could obtain more data?
- Concept map / hyperlink features are solid as is.
- Highlighting mode is not immediately off-putting.
- Potential market, could be strengthened by commercials remarking on the minimal eyestrain when reading from an iPad.
