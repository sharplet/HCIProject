<h2 id="scenario_1">Information Scenario 1</h2>
<p>Jill has to read a chapter about the Taylor series for her numerical methods class, however she has forgotten much of the basics of the Taylor series that she had learned in calculus and must reteach herself the basics before she moves on to the more advanced material. She starts by trying to read the assigned chapter from her numerical methods textbook, but quickly becomes lost and frustrated, as the textbook assumes that the reader will have basic knowledge of the Taylor series.</p>
<p>Jill then remembers overhearing a fellow student talking about a new application for the iPad that integrates textbooks with information on the internet to create a cohesive learning experience. Jill decides she has nothing to lose, so she downloads the application along with the textbook and searches for the section on the Taylor series using the provided index. Jill is immediately impressed with the intuitive integration of an index that is always ready to be used by tapping the index button on the application&#8217;s drop down menu (<a href="./information_design_claims.html#claim1">Claim 1</a>). She enjoys how tapping the pages of the book displays this drop down menu, and tapping the page again would hide the menu. Jill then types the page number for the Taylor series in the &#8216;Jump to Page&#8217; section listed in the drop down menu, and is immediately taken to her desired section. When she arrives on the page, she discovers links on the side of the page that lead to both concepts that can help understand the Taylor series, as well as links to advanced topics involving the Taylor series (<a href="./information_design_claims.html#claim2">Claim 2</a>). Jill immediately clicks on the first link leading to the basics of the Taylor series. To her surprise, the application does not have to close to open a browser, she discovers that the browser is actually embedded into the application (<a href="./information_design_claims.html#claim3">Claim 3</a>). To further justify her decision to download the application, Jill finds the website she clicked on to be incredibly useful. She is able to quickly remember all that she had been taught about the Taylor series in previous classes. She then closes the browser and is returned to the first page of her reading assignment. Jill then reads her assigned chapter in the textbook, and is now finally able to understand the content. Jill closes the application with a sense of accomplishment and happiness, for she is no longer behind in her numerical methods class.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> While writing this information scenario, we really wanted to focus on how we plan on using a drop down menu to navigate to most parts of the textbook. This dropdown menu, while not finalized, will have links to the index, specific pages, as well as buttons to click when a user wants to take notes or annotate a page. Another feature we looked at when writing this scenario was how the links will be displayed to the user. We wanted the links to be quickly accessible at any time, so we have them on the right side of the page after any newly introduced concept. </p>
<h2 id="scenario_2">Information Scenario 2</h2>
<p>Bill is an excellent student, and has just finished taking a class on statistical analysis. Bill would like to learn more about statistics, but his university does not offer any more advanced statistics courses. After absorbing what little of his textbook that his class did not cover, bill consulted the concept map on his e-textbook reader to find further interesting topics within statistics that he could read up on and what books he should buy. After buying and downloading the necessary books onto his mobile reading device, Bill realized he was running low on hard-drive space, and deleted some old books from his drive, secure in the fact that they would be available for re-download if he needed them later. Bill then set out to absorb the new wealth of knowledge that his new books provided, reading linearly as necessary, but easily searching for specific topics and skipping around material he already knew thanks to the concept map organization and the built in search feature of his e-textbooks. Bill is also able to highlight and write annotations about important information, with all of his notes being added to his concept map at the appropriate places for easy searching. He loves how easy it is to annotate a block of text. All he has to do is select the text he wishes to make a note of, then choose &#8216;create note&#8217; from the pop-up menu that displays. As soon as he clicks &#8216;create note&#8217; he notices this brings up the iPad&#8217;s onscreen keyboard, and he can type an unlimited amount of characters into this annotation, which he found useful as Bill has always been made fun of for how many notes he takes (<a href="./information_design_claims.html#claim4">Claim 4</a>). Bill&#8217;s favorite thing to do within a textbook however, is to highlight bits of text he finds to be the most interesting. He especially loves to do this within the application, because all he has to do is select the text he wishes to highlight, and then click &#8216;Highlight&#8217; within the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>Bill was also extremely excited to find out that one of the books he had purchased had embedded videos of MIT Open Courseware lectures on for each major topic in the textbook, allowing him to rest his eyes a bit by listening to the lectures rather than continuing his focused reading (<a href="./information_design_claims.html#claim5">Claim 5</a>). Finally, thanks to the sleek design and small form factor of his mobile reading device, Bill can easily go on a walk and read in his local park without being encumbered by an overly large paper textbook or laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> For this information scenario, we were focused on how we were going to create and display annotations. A way to create searchable notes was something that we thought would be extremely useful to the user and we didn&#8217;t want to limit the amount of characters that could be input. The use of a pop-up menu was chosen, as we wanted as little clutter as possible on screen at one time. As soon as the user is done choosing within the menu, it will disappear and the user will only see his or her book again. We wanted highlighting to be as intuitive as possible as well, so the decision to have the user select text, bring up the pop-up menu and click &#8216;highlight&#8217; seemed to be the best choice.</p>
