      <h2 id='activity_scenarios'>Activity scenarios</h2>
      <h3 id='scenario_1'>Scenario 1</h3><p>Jill has to read a chapter about the Taylor series for her numerical methods class, however she has forgotten much of the basics of the Taylor series that she had learned in calculus and must reteach herself the basics before she moves on to the more advanced material. She starts by trying to read the assigned chapter from her numerical methods textbook, but quickly becomes lost and frustrated, as the textbook assumes that the reader will have basic knowledge of the Taylor series.</p><p>Jill then remembers overhearing a fellow student talking about a new application for the iPad that integrates textbooks with information on the internet to create a cohesive learning experience. Jill decides she has nothing to lose, so she downloads the application along with the textbook (<b><a href='./activity-claims.html#claim_1'>Claim 1</a></b>) and searches for the section on the Taylor series. (<b><a href='./activity-claims.html#claim_2'>Claim 2</a></b>) When she arrives on the page, she discovers links on the side of the page that lead to both concepts that can help understand the Taylor series, as well as links to advanced topics involving the Taylor series. Jill immediately clicks on the first link leading to the basics of the Taylor series. To her surprise, the application does not have to close to open a browser, she discovers that the browser is actually imbedded into the application. To further justify her decision to download the application, Jill finds the website she clicked on to be incredibly useful. She is able to quickly remember all that she had been taught about the Taylor series in previous classes. She then closes the browser and is returned to the first page of her reading assignment. Jill then reads her assigned chapter in the textbook, and is now finally able to understand the content. Jill closes the application with a sense of accomplishment and happiness, for she is no longer behind in her numerical methods class.</p><p><strong>Discussion: </strong> For this scenario, we wanted to focus on the navigation of links with respect to those that access the internet.  This focuses on the claim in the problem scenario that, "There are many available websites containing all or parts of information needed."  The way we address the negative of the claim, which was "information on the web is often poorly presented in comparison to textbooks", was to infer that links uploaded by creators of the concept map will almost always be useful and understandable to the user.</p><h3 id='scenario_2'>Scenario 2</h3><p>Bill is an excellent student, and has just finished taking a class on statistical analysis. Bill would like to learn more about statistics, but his university does not offer any more advanced statistics courses. Bill has recently purchased an iPad, and while looking for information on advanced statistics courses read about a digital textbook application that was recently released. Bill decided to give it a try, as the app and your first textbook purchase within it were free.</p><p>Bill found an advanced statistics book that looked promising and had positive recommendations, so he purchased it. When he started reading he got worried though, as the "Who should read this book?" section was incredibly confusing and written in a very dense style with lots of words his professors had never used. Fortunately, right beside the section he was reading was a link which displayed a list of related texts, each one with a description of its content, and linked to a phrase in the paragraph he was reading. Many of the links were other textbooks available in the app, and when he followed those links he was able to read the samples of those texts. (<b><a href='./activity-claims.html#claim_3'>Claim 3</a></b>) Bill didn't want to buy a whole new textbook yet, so he went back to the collection of links and browsed the web links instead. Bill was very impressed -- all of the sites the book linked to were incredibly useful, and he understood them well! He had never been able to find this sort of thing just using Google. It turned out that he did understand what his textbook was talking about, but because he had learned it in a certain way, the textbook's explanation had been foreign to him. He returned to the section he had read by tapping a button, and read on, energised by his new-found understanding. Whenever Bill came across terminology that he was not familiar with, there would always be links available to useful web sites, texts, videos, talks and presentations and more, so he could always fill in the gaps in his understanding.</p><p>It had been hours since Bill had started studying, but strangely his eyes did not feel as strained as they usually did when he was reading on his laptop. He much preferred reading on his iPad, and navigating the textbooks felt so much more natural when using the touch interface instead of a keyboard or mouse. It was fast, too: to jump to another part of the book he could follow one of the links if it happened to be directly related, or pinch in with his fingers to get a view of the book at a higher navigation level, then swipe through until he found where he wanted to be, tapping on the page to enlarge it for the reading view. This felt a lot like flipping through through the pages of a real textbook while keeping an eye in the top corner of the page to see what section you were landing on. But he could only do that with paperbacks, and most of his books were hardcover books that made this sort of navigation yet more difficult. Bill new that any book he purchased in this digital textbook reader would be navigable in just the same way. </p><p>Outdoors, the glare from the sun was still an issue. But Bill found that this application made his regular study sessions far more effective, and was usually studying indoors. If he wanted to go outdoors he could always find some shade, and the iPad was the perfect form factor for carrying around and reading. (<b><a href='./activity-claims.html'>Claim 4</a></b>)</p><p>Now that he had had such an effective reading and study time, he tried to see if any of his existing textbooks were available. And sure enough, any of his books that he knew were available in ePub format were already available here. When he downloaded one of them, to his surprise he found that the same sorts of links were there, and had been added by other students who had found useful sites. Not all textbooks had the same amount of links, but there was a note in the store that said book publishers were constantly working to improve the quality and number of these links. Bill could also create links, and so he linked the textbook from his last class to the new one he had bought. (<b><a href='./activity-claims.html#claim_5'>Claim 5</a></b>) He hoped that other students would find that as useful as he had.</p><p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The scenario address problem claim 3 by dealing with the deluge of information that can often come with searching the web. In this system, links to related content are curated by content creators, and so there is much less information, and what is presented is more useful. Problem claim 4 is addressed by noting that eye strain is much less when reading on an iPad, as the pixel density is much higher than on standard computer displays. The negatives of claim 5 are not addressed directly, as the iPad still has a lot of glare in sunlight. However, while studying textbooks users will usually be indoors.</p>
