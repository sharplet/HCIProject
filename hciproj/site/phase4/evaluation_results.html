      <ul>
      <li>With one exception all participants are male.</li>
      
      <li>Ages range from 19-24.</li>
      
      <li>No participants own an iPad or Kindle.</li>
      
      <li>Participants read an average of 2-3 hours per week.</li>
      
      <li>Participants may have been biased as prototype interaction was performed with notable tester aid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id='participants_responses'>Participants&#8217; responses</h4>
      
      <p><img src='../images/users.png' alt='Chart of users' /></p>
      
      <p>This graph represents the mean, mode, and variance of a given participant&#8217;s responses. We analyzed this data to determine whether there were any patterns in the responses, or any significant outliers in baseline rating.</p>
      
      <p>Observations:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Overall variance is 0.17. This suggests participants rated with a reasonably consistent baseline.</li>
      
      <li>Another possibility is that our sample was too narrow.</li>
      
      <li>There was only one rating of 2, given by Participant 7 for Feature D.</li>
      
      <li>Participant 7 rated the features consistently high, with the sole exception of Feature D. This anomolous data lends credence to the idea that Participant 7 was trying to rate objectively, and perhaps merits further investigation.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 id='feature_ratings'>Feature ratings</h4>
      
      <p><img src='../images/questions.png' alt='Chart of questions' /></p>
      
      <p>This graph deals specifically with the features and the ratings given to them. The legend below connects the letters with the actual survey questions.</p>
      <table>
      <tr><td>A</td><td>Discovering the ability to view concept map links was intuitive.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>B</td><td>When following links, I found it easy to return to my original textbook page.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>C</td><td>Flipping through pages linearly was easy and instinctive.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>D</td><td>The ìpagesî view of the textbook was as easy to navigate as a paper textbook.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>E</td><td>Navigating through different concepts was made easy with the integration of a concept map.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>F</td><td>Creation and annotation of notes is an easy to use and desirable feature within the e-textbook.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>G</td><td>The highlighting tool was easy and intuitive to use.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Observations:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Covariance between mean and variance is -.07, indicating that the higher the mean was the lower the variance. This is promising, as it suggests people agreed more on highly rated features.</li>
      
      <li>Features A, C, E, and G were largely agreed to be successful features.</li>
      
      <li>Feature D was the most contentious.</li>
      
      <li>Only Feature D was outside of 1 standard deviation. Other data points should be considered reliable.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id='interview_observations'>Interview Observations</h3>
      
      <ul>
      <li>5/8 participants mentioned highlighting as a strength of the prototype over traditional textbooks.</li>
      
      <li>The above seemed contingent on there being a way to remove the highlighting.</li>
      
      <li>6/8 mentioned the concept map or related features as a strength, insofar as they supervened on the normal book experience.</li>
      
      <li>4/8 mentioned the inconvenience of reading from a screen as a prominent dislike.</li>
      
      <li>6/8 would use the ebook reader if available instead of traditional textbooks. The remaining two mentioned the intrinsic enjoyment of tactile feedback as counter reasons.</li>
      
      <li>Several mentioned weight as the main reason why they would use the ebook reader over traditional textbooks.</li>
      
      <li>Highlighting for e-books did not feel destructive, which alleviates a psychological downside to traditional textbooks.</li>
      
      <li>One user remarked on the great convenience of the quick-bookmark feature.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id='conclusions'>Conclusions</h3>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Cannot remove highlighting once it is in place. Must rectify this.</li>
      
      <li>Page flipping feature is contested, but data is too inconsistent to make a firm judgment. Could obtain more data?</li>
      
      <li>Concept map / hyperlink features are solid as is.</li>
      
      <li>Highlighting mode is not immediately off-putting.</li>
      
      <li>Potential market, could be strengthened by commercials remarking on the minimal eyestrain when reading from an iPad.</li>
