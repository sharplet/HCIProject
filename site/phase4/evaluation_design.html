      <h2 id='evaluation_design'>Evaluation Design</h2>
      
      <h3 id='overall_goals'>Overall Goals</h3>
      
      <p>The overall goals of this evaluation was to determine whether our implementation is a) more intuitive/useful than a paper textbook, and b) determine ways in which to improve our current design.</p>
      
      <h3 id='critical_aspects'>Critical Aspects</h3>
      
      <p>Aspects we will be evaluating are:</p>
      
      <ol>
      <li>Ease of use of our prototype relative to a paper book.</li>
      
      <li>The intuitiveness of the concept map.</li>
      
      <li>Usefulness of the concept map.</li>
      
      <li>Ease of returning to the original text after going to a link.</li>
      
      <li>Intuitiveness of the linear text reading mode.</li>
      
      <li>Usefulness and intuitiveness of note taking and highlighting features.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Metrics used were the responses from simple Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree multiple choice questions as well as short answer user response questions.</p>
      
      <h3 id='evaluation_type'>Evaluation Type</h3>
      
      <p>For this project we used an empirical evaluation performed by by average users. (We assume that that white male engineering students age 18-25 are totally representative of the average user.)</p>
      
      <h3 id='recruitment_of_subjects'>Recruitment of Subjects</h3>
      
      <p>Many of the subjects were recruited from friends of Richard&#8217;s that attended a &#8216;dinner and board games night&#8217; that Richard hosted over the weekend. The other participants were friends of Adam&#8217;s that had shown an interest in participating.</p>
      
      <h3 id='procedure'>Procedure</h3>
      
      <p>The procedure for the usability survey was as follows:</p>
      
      <ol>
      <li>Participants were thanked for agreeing to participate and asked to complete an <a href='./appendices.html#informed_consent_form'>informed consent form</a>.</li>
      
      <li>Participants completed the <a href='./appendices.html#background_questionnaire'>background questionnaire</a> at survey.vt.edu.</li>
      
      <li>Adam proceeded to explain to the participant the idea behind the prototype, and walk the participant through each feature of the prototype. (The reason for this walk-through approach is that the prototype in Keynote was not completely interactive. This does have the disadvantage of not being able to assess discoverability of features.)</li>
      
      <li>Having completed the prototype walk-through, Adam left the room so that the participant could complete the <a href='./appendices.html#usability_survey_questionnaire'>usability survey questionnaire</a> anonymously.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3 id='metrics'>Metrics</h3>
      
      <p>The metrics we used were simply user response data in the form of agree/disagree questions and short answer questions.</p>
      
      <h3 id='analysis'>Analysis</h3>
      
      <p>We will be analyzing the agree/disagree questions by performing various statistical analysis on them in Excel.</p>
      
      <p>The short answer questions we will have to evaluate by hand, and determine for ourselves which comments justify design changes.</p>
