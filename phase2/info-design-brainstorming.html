			<tr><th class="header" colspan=3>Metaphors</th></tr>
			<tr><th>Information</th><th class="metaphor">Metaphor</th><th>Implications</th></tr>
		<tr><th>Links to related concepts</th>
		<td class="subpoint">An annotated bibliography or reference list, search engine results</td>
		<td class="subpoint">The idea is to move away from the obvious visual representation of a concept map and toward a more palatable form. Provide an easy to digest list of curated sources, which will be presented in a way similar to search engine results but much more useful and reliable.</td></tr>
		<tr><th>User annotations to text</th>
		<td class="subpoint">Margin notes</td>
		<td class="subpoint">Display an icon or shading in the margin that indicates where a note has been written. Given this metaphor there is no real affordance that notes can be written in the margins: could provide a "mode of sorts" where you could tap on the text you wish to annotate and you are automatically shifted into the margin or pop-up to write the note.</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Highlighted text</th>
		<td class="subpoint">Highlighting a real book</td>
		<td class="subpoint">User can use their finger as if it were a highlighted and emphasize text that is important. Highlighted text is represented just as if it were a real textbook.</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Indicating to a user that they can link to content they found useful</th>
		<td class="subpoint">Verbal/other sharing of things students have found helpful, whether a web page or textbook chapter or something else</td>
		<td class="subpoint">In the context of viewing related/supporting texts (from the concept map), indicate to the user that they can "Add a link to a resource you [they] found helpful...." Provides a native (i.e. in-app) way for users to share content they've found helpful.</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Textbook content</th>
		<td class="subpoint">Real-world textbook</td>
		<td class="subpoint">People are comfortable with idea of textbooks and the way they work. In replicating textbook in digital format, it would be beneficial to the user to avoid giving them a completely unfamiliar and un-textbook-like experience. Use pagination instead of scrolling. Use a page-turn animation to explicitly show the user they are moving to the next page. A digital model of a real-world page gives the affordance that it can be interacted with in the same way as a real-world page.</td></tr>
		<tr><th rowspan=2>Amount still to read / position in book</th>
		<td class="subpoint">Thickness of book</td>
		<td class="subpoint">Can't really be replicated adequately with a divide like the iPad, which has constant thickness. The thickness of the book could be represented visually, but this would be a too-indirect means of communicating the amount left to read.</td>
		</tr><tr>
		<td class="subpoint">Number of pages left</td>
		<td class="subpoint">Indicate to the user the total number of pages and how many there are left to read. Show progress as a kind of timeline/continuum, i.e., a one-dimensional representation of the page you're on compared to the total number of pages.</td></tr>
		</table>

			<tr><th class="header" colspan=3>Technology</th></tr>
			<tr><th>Information</th><th>Technology</th><th>Implications</th></tr>
			<tr><th>A page looks like a...</th><td class="subpoint">PDF</td><td class="subpoint">The book is separated into indiviual pages</td></tr>
			<tr><th>An embedded video is like a...</th><td class="subpoint">DVD player</td><td class="subpoint">The book can play embedded videos</td></tr>
			<tr><th>An annotation is like a...</th><td class="subpoint">Tomboy note</td><td class="subpoint">The book allows the user to create notes about the text.</td></tr>

    <h2>Discussion with client for information design</h2>
    <p>The activity of traversing the concept map from subjects that are not understood to find a concept that is understood came from the latest meeting with our client. The user should be able to go from a concept they don&#8217;t understand, and follow &#8220;prerequisite concept&#8221; links until they find a concept they understand.</p>

    <p>This will be represented to the user through different types of links. Elaboration links, links on the same level of the hierarchy, will be like asides that cover examples or related concepts in the text. Prerequisite links will be to concepts that are foundational to the current one. The user will be able to differentiate between these, possibly with a colour-coding scheme or some other delineation. As the user follows successive prerequisite links, they will be able to use the standard iOS breadcrumb trail style back buttons to return to their initial position. See the representations page for a visual diagram of this.</p>
